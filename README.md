### A bash script for downloading workshop items, simple as.

## Dependencies
- steamcmd
  
## Running
1. Clone the repo
2. `chmod +x steamdl.sh`
3. `./steamdl.sh`

## Contributing
You can contribute in any way you want, I'm also up for new name ideas for this app as I think the current one is too bland.

## Known issues
- Doesn't work on Gentoo, if steamcmd was installed using the ebuild.

## To-do
- Make a promptless version
